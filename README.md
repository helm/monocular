Status](https://travis-ci.org/helm/monocular.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/helm/monocular)

Monocular is web-based UI for managing Kubernetes applications packaged as Helm
Charts. It allows you to search and discover available charts from multiple
repositories, and install them in your cluster with one click.
