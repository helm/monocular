# Monocular
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/helm/monocular.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/helm/monocular)

Monocular is a web-based application that enables the search and discovery of
charts from multiple Helm Chart repositories. It is the codebase that powers the
[Helm Hub](https://github.com/helm/hub) project.

## ⚠️ Deprecation and Archive Notice

Monocular is deprecated and no longer supported. There have been no new updates
to the codebase since March 2020. It has now been deprecated by the maintainers.

If you need an open source project to display your charts you may consider using
the [Artifact Hub](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub) (which you can
[run yourself](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/artifact-hub/artifact-hub)).
Helm uses the Artifact Hub software to power the built-in hub search.

## Install

You can use the chart in this repository to install Monocular in your cluster.

### Prerequisites
- [Helm and Tiller installed](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#quickstart)
- [Nginx Ingress controller](https://kubeapps.com/charts/stable/nginx-ingress)
  - Install with Helm: `helm install stable/nginx-ingress`
  - **Minikube/Kubeadm**: `helm install stable/nginx-ingress --set controller.hostNetwork=true`


```console
$ helm repo add monocular https://helm.github.io/monocular
$ helm install monocular/monocular
```

### Access Monocular

Use the Ingress endpoint to access your Monocular instance:

```console
# Wait for all pods to be running (this can take a few minutes)
$ kubectl get pods --watch

$ kubectl get ingress
NAME                        HOSTS     ADDRESS         PORTS     AGE
tailored-alpaca-monocular   *         192.168.64.30   80        11h
```

Visit the address specified in the Ingress object in your browser, e.g. http://192.168.64.30.

## Looking for an in-cluster Application management UI?

To focus on the CNCF Helm Hub requirements, in-cluster features have been
removed from Monocular 1.0 and above. We believe that providing a good solution
for deploying and managing apps in-cluster is an orthogonal user experience to a
public search and discovery site. There is other tooling that can support this
usecase better (e.g. [Kubeapps](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps) or [RedHat
Automation
Broker](https://blog.openshift.com/automation-broker-discovering-helm-charts/)).

[Monocular v0.7.3](https://github.com/helm/monocular/releases/tag/v0.7.3)
includes in-cluster features and can still be installed and used until your team
has migrated to another tool.

## Roadmap
