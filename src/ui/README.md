# Monocular UI

The UI is a web client for the [Monocular
API](https://github.com/kubernetes-helm/monocular/tree/master/src/api), which exposes an easy way to
navigate and search [Helm Charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts).

Regarding its functionality we can highlight:

* Listing of available and curated charts.
* Search mechanism.
* Chart information page, which includes instructions on how to use the
  chart, how to install it, etc.

## Developers

### Running Monocular UI

Monocular UI requires a running instance of the Monocular backend.

The easiest way to have a running multi-tier development environment is to use the the `docker-compose.yml` file placed at the project root directory.

Refer to [Running a development environment](src/README.md) for more details.
